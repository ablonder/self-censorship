# Why do people stay silent instead of speaking up?

When faced with censorship, people often "self-censor," staying silent even more than they really need to.
We propose that this paradoxical silence is the result of uncertainty - about the official censorship line and about the opinions of those around you.

To test out this theory, we have simulated a social network of people sharing opinions and learning from each other. They learn whether dissidents have a minority or majority opinion from their neighbors and use that information to decide whether it's worth speaking up and risking censorship or social censure. We show how, if no one speaks up because they're not sure if they will be censured, then they will never be able to learn if their neighbors actually share their dissenting opinions, and everyone will stay stuck in a vicious cycle of silence.
Further investigation of the model will help us find ways to escape this cycle of self-censorship.
