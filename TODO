-express intensity of opinion rather than just [agree, silent, disagree]
-censorship (turn person's expression to silent) occurs with some probability (default .5) for opinions above a set intensity (default .8)
-probability of expression is just a parameter of intensity of opinion (default .5), but what opinion they express is min(censorship, their opinion)
-update percieved censorship = old percetion + learning rate*(max(self and neighbors) - old perception)
-parameterize initial percieved censorship (default 1)
-remove sensitivity learning (reparameterize)

Later steps:
-add component of people with privilaged information
